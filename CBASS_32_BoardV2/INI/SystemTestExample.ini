// This is a possible test of heating and cooling capability.
// Run it under then most realistic conditions possible, as your
// home lab and a makeshift setup under a tarp in the tropics will
// not give the same results!
//
// The idea is to demand ramp rates which cannot actually be achieved
// and see what the system delivers in degress  per minute.  This gives
// you two things
// 1) If your existing equipment can not deliver what your experiment
//    requires, now you know.  Get more powerful.
// 2) Anecdotally, PID control works best when devices are run at roughly
//    a 50% duty cycle.  Consider different heating or cooling choices
//    if this is not the case.  The 50% value is just a guideline.  
//    20% to 80% may be acceptable.
//
// Adjust temperatures to include the maximum range you plan to test.
