Files in this directory (/htdocs) are meant to be served from the 
CBASS-32 internal web server.  On CBASS-32 they are served from an
internal filesystem, not direct from the microSD card.  Therefore,
any changes must be followed by a run of SPIFFS_upload.

The files come in several categories.

1) plotly.js is a third-party library released under license.  Please see
   their license file in this directory (PLOTLY_LICENSE.TXT).

2) trash.png and plus_circle.png are icons from free search sites.  They
   may have additional licensing requirements.

3) page.css is a product of Steve Ryan with help from internet sites.
   Consider it public domain.

4) favicon.ico represents the CBASS-R/CBASS-32 coral polyp as seen on
   the circuit boards.  Please treat it as a trademark of those products,
   though it is not legally registered.
